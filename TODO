* ISSUES
** BUG some children are not re-attached properly to parent branches upon smoothing
** BUG Negative conical length distribution doesn't work
** BUG Report upstream: cmake install same file same place fucks up
** DEFECT Supply some proper mygui.ini 
** DEFECT Make "smoothing resolution" setting be on per-level basis
** IMPROVEMENT Make configurable font and size
** IMPROVEMENT Complete translation
** IMPROVEMENT make (option?) for config not to save default settings to file
** IMPROVEMENT thickening on branching points
** IMPROVEMENT branch splitting
** IMPROVEMENT children directions rebalancing
1. take all children vectors (maybe even crowncenter->endpoint vectors)
2. find sum of them all -- that number is OFFSET
3. substract that offset from every child
** IMPROVEMENT Expose all the scene settings
*** That would be Light config, Zone config
** IMPROVEMENT Material editor
** IMPROVEMENT Multi-polygon leaves/blandes?
** TRIVIALL rename smoothing resolution "curve base resolution"
** TRIVIALL rename num_segments to "num internal segments" and increase the limit
** TRIVIALL add per-level setting of number of segments in crossection of a branch
** DONE Inconsistent leaves level numbering
Why outmost level is named 1,  not 0 in GUI?
** DONE Translation id strings are not autoregenerated on build 
** DONE Subdir build is broken?  
** DONE Exporting trunk only crashes blender importer
** DONE Leaves upward normal direction
** DONE direction mirroring on branching points
** DONE OPTION make sure there is a loop cut on branching point
Otherwise a branch will start from empty space
** DONE adjust options and their labels widths properly
** DONE Setting UI labels do not fit well
** DONE Supply some proper presets in build tree and on install
*** Birch -- young, mature and silver birch
*** Apple?
*** Maple is not possible yet
** DONE Document the UI
Add [?] tooltips as it's done in ImGUI samples
** DONE Add "release" distribution packing automation
** DONE Default tree is shit
** DONE Propagate our warning options to contrib vcppbits and urhobits
** DONE config file has extra zeros on floating point numbers
** DONE Warnings
@rokas
warnnings are because of
  if (UNIX)
    set(ADDITIONAL_CXX_FLAGS "-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Wno-switch -Wuninitialized  -Wshadow -Wredundant-decls -Wdisabled-optimization -Wnoexcept -Wsign-compare -Wsign-conversion -Wstrict-aliasing")
  endif ()
you should not enable them globally like that. dependencies are large and out of
your control, there is no point in enabling those warnings for them. do this
only for your own code
** DONE Improve build times
** DONE Crash when setting 'levels' setting to 5
** DONE Default leaf texture name is not present in Data folder?
** DONE Inconsistant children branches positions depending on smoothing
** DONE Make children grow out of already smoothed and simplified branches
** DONE Second (graphical) segment of the tree has wrong texture
** DONE When switching preset, camera doesn't refocus on the center
** DONE Cleanup ui from temporary clutter
** CANCELED Add alternative algorithm for smoothing
The one where you can set minimal degrees between subsequent segments

RESOLUTION: just keep improving the default (precise) algorithm and think of others later
** CANCELED Leaves texture is not consistant with presets selection..
You load a tree with default texture, switch to tree with maple, then back and u
still have maple...

Is it actually solved
** CANCELED readjust branch root position when smoothing
OR just calculate branch position right before rendering it, instead of caching
branch position in branch data structure
*** Solution 1 readjust the children
**** problem 1
when we render the list of Branch[] and Leaf[] data, we have all relations lost,
so there is no way to recalculate children position based on parent
*** Solution 2 just add a split at the point, and forbid it's elision later
*** Solution 3 rebalance the branch subdivision points
